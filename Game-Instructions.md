## Game Instructions

Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file.  The instructions should be clear enough for any non-technical computer user to understand and follow.

Welcome to Flappy Bird! Game play is quite simple. 

To start the game, simply follow the instructions on the screen and click the mouse to start the game.

Once you have started the game, wait for the countdown. The bird will then move either by a mouse click anywhere on the screen, or by pressing the space bar. I would reccomend using the space bar to operate the bird if you only have a trackpad.

The object of the game is to fly the bird between the pipe obstacles. You DO NOT want to hit the pipes! If you hit a pipe, the game is over. 

To make the bird fly higher, click the mouse or press the spacebar, the brid will begin to fall when you stop clicking/pressing spacebar. You will need to click/ press spacebar more for pipe gaps that are higher, and stop clicking/ pressing spacebar for pipe gaps that are lower.

During game play, you will receive 1 point for every set of pipes that you successfully pass. 

Good Luck!
